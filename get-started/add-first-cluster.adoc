+
Project Astra uses the service account to discover the clusters running in the Google Kubernetes Engine projects that are associated with the service account.

. *Compute*: Select the cluster that you'd like to add and click *Configure storage*.
+
Pay careful attention to the Eligible tab. If a warning appears, hover over the warning to determine if there's an issue with the cluster. For example, it might identify the cluster doesn't have a worker node.

. *Storage*: Select the default storage class that you'd like to use with this cluster and click *Review information*.
+
Each storage class utilizes https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-service-for-gcp[Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud^].

. *Review & Approve*: Review the configuration details and click *Add compute*.
