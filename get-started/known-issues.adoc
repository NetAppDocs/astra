Known issues identify problems that might prevent you from using this release of the product successfully.

== Clone performance impacted by large persistent volumes

Clones of very large and consumed persistent volumes might be intermittently slow, dependent on cluster access to the object store. If the clone is hung and no data has been copied for more than 30 minutes, Astra terminates the clone action.

== Clone fails after deleting a backup

If you delete a backup that's used for an active clone operation, the clone fails and the newly cloned app gets stuck in a provisioning state. Contact NetApp support to clear the stuck app from the application listing.
