Known issues identify problems that might prevent you from using this release of the product successfully.

== Google Marketplace

Applications deployed from Google Marketplace have not been validated. Some users report issues with discovery and/or backup with Google Marketplace deployments of Postgres, MariaDB, and MySQL.

== Clone performance impacted by large persistent volumes

Clones of very large and consumed persistent volumes might be intermittently slow, dependent on cluster access to the object store. If the clone is hung and no data has been copied for more than 30 minutes, Astra terminates the clone action.
