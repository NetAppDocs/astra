A few steps are required to prepare your Microsoft Azure subscription before you can manage Azure Kubernetes Service clusters with Astra.

== Quick start for setting up Azure

Get started quickly by following these steps or scroll down to the remaining sections for full details.

== AKS cluster requirements

A Kubernetes cluster must meet the following requirements so you can discover and manage it from Astra.

Kubernetes version:: Clusters must be running Kubernetes version 1.17 or later.

Image type:: The image type for each worker node must be Ubuntu.

Cluster state:: Clusters must be running in a healthy state and have at least one online worker node with no worker nodes in a failed state.

Azure region:: Clusters must reside in a region where Azure NetApp Files is available. https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=netapp[View Azure products by region^].

Subscription:: Clusters must reside in a subscription where Azure NetApp Files is enabled.

VNet::
* Clusters must reside in a VNet that has direct access to an Azure NetApp Files delegated subnet.
*	If the cluster's VNet is peered to another VNet with an Azure NetApp Files delegated subnet, then both sides of the peering connection must be online.
*	A VNet must not have more than 800 IP addresses in use across all VNets touching a delegated subnet.

Private networking:: Private networking must not be enabled on a cluster.

Volume snapshot controller:: Clusters must have a CSI volume snapshot controller installed. This controller is installed by default on K8s version 1.20, but you'll need to check on clusters running versions 1.17, 1.18, or 1.19.

== Register for Azure NetApp Files

Get access to Azure NetApp Files by submitting a waitlist request. After you're approved, you'll need to register the NetApp Resource Provider.

.Steps

. https://aka.ms/azurenetappfiles[Submit a waitlist request to access Azure NetApp Files^].

. Wait for a confirmation email from the Azure NetApp Files team.

. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-register#resource-provider[Follow Azure NetApp Files documentation to register the NetApp Resource Provider^].

== Create a NetApp account

After you've been granted access, create a NetApp account in Azure NetApp Files.

.Step

. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-create-netapp-account[Follow Azure NetApp Files documentation to create a NetApp account from the Azure portal^].

== Set up a capacity pool

One or more capacity pools are required so that Astra can provision persistent volumes in a capacity pool. Astra doesn't create capacity pools for you.

Take the following into consideration as you set up capacity pools for your Kubernetes apps:

* A capacity pool can have an Ultra, Premium, or Standard service level. These service levels provide different levels of performance. Astra supports all three.
+
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-service-levels[Learn more about service levels for Azure NetApp Files^].

* Before you create a capacity pool for the apps that you intend to protect with Astra, choose the required performance and capacity for those apps.
+
Provisioning the right amount of capacity ensures that users can create persistent volumes as they are needed. If capacity isn't available, then the persistent volumes can't be provisioned.

* A capacity pool can use the manual or auto QoS type. Astra supports auto QoS capacity pools. Manual QoS capacity pools aren't supported.

.Step

. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-set-up-capacity-pool[Follow Azure NetApp Files documentation to set up a capacity pool^].

== Delegate a subnet to Azure NetApp Files

You need to delegate a subnet to Azure NetApp Files so that Astra can create persistent volumes in that subnet. You can have only one delegated subnet in a VNet.

.Step

. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-delegate-subnet[Follow the Azure NetApp Files documentation to delegate a subnet to Azure NetApp Files].

== Create an Azure service principal

Astra requires an Azure service principal that is assigned the Contributor role. Astra uses this service principal to facilitate Kubernetes application data management on your behalf.

A service principal is an identity created specifically for use with applications, services, and tools. Assigning a role to the service principal restricts access to specific Azure resources.

Azure offers several ways to create a service principal. The steps below show how to create a service principal using the Azure CLI. Refer to Azure documentation for more details and additional methods:

* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli[Create an Azure service principal with the Azure CLI^]
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal[Use the portal to create an Azure AD application and service principal that can access resources^]
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-authenticate-service-principal-powershell[Use Azure PowerShell to create a service principal with a certificate^]

The following steps assume that you have permission to create service principals and that you have the Microsoft Azure SDK (az command) installed on your machine.

.Requirements

*	The service principal must be use regular authentication. Credentials aren't supported.
* The service principal must reside in the same Azure subscription as your AKS clusters and your Azure NetApp Files account.

.Steps

. Identify the subscription and tenant ID where your AKS clusters reside (these are the clusters that you want to manage in Astra).
+
[source,azureCLI]
az configure --list-defaults
az account list --output table

. Create the service principal, assign the Contributor role, and specify the scope to the entire subscription.
+
[source,azurecli]
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name http://sp-astra-service-principal --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/SUBSCRIPTION-ID

. Optional: Test your service principal.
+
[source,azurecli]
az login --service-principal --username APP-ID-SERVICEPRINCIPAL --password SECRET --tenant TENANT-ID
az group list --subscription SUBSCRIPTION-ID
az aks list --subscription SUBSCRIPTION-ID
az storage container list --subscription SUBSCRIPTION-ID
