Get started by verifying support for your Kubernetes clusters, apps, and web browser.

== Kubernetes cluster requirements

A Kubernetes cluster must meet the following requirements so you can discover and manage it from Astra.

Kubernetes deployment:: Astra supports Kubernetes clusters that are managed by Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
+
On-prem Kubernetes clusters and clusters managed by other cloud managed services are not supported at this time.

Google Cloud region:: Clusters must be running in a https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions#cvsGc[Google Cloud region where Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud is supported.] Note that both service types are supported: CVS and CVS-Performance.

Kubernetes version:: A cluster must be running Kubernetes version 1.17 or later.

Image type:: The image type for each worker node must be Ubuntu.

Cluster state:: Clusters must be running in a healthy state and have at least one online worker node.

Networking:: The cluster must reside in a VPC that is peered with Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud. link:set-up-google-cloud.html#set-up-network-peering-for-your-vpc-2[Learn how to set up peering].

Private clusters:: If the cluster is private, it must have the https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/private-cluster-concept[master authorized network^] set to allow the Astra IP addresses:
*	54.164.233.140/32
*	3.218.120.204/32
*	34.193.99.138/32

== Supported apps

Astra supports all applications running on your Kubernetes clusters. link:../release-notes/known-limitations.html[Note that there is a known limitation with apps deployed from the Google Marketplace].

NetApp has validated some apps to ensure the safety and consistency of the snapshots and backups. link:../learn/validated-vs-standard.html[Learn the difference between a validated app and a standard app].

No matter which type of app that you use with Astra, you should always test the backup and restore workflow yourself to ensure that you can meet your disaster recovery requirements.

== Supported web browsers

Astra supports recent versions of Firefox, Safari, and Chrome with a minimum resolution of 1280 x 720.
