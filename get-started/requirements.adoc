Get started by verifying support for your Kubernetes clusters and apps.

== Supported Kubernetes clusters

* Project Astra supports Kubernetes clusters that are managed by Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
+
On-prem Kubernetes clusters and clusters running in other cloud providers are not supported at this time.

* Clusters must be running in a healthy state, in a https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions#cvsGc[Google Cloud region that supports Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud^].

* A cluster must be running Kubernetes version 1.17 or later.

* The cluster must have at least one online worker node.

* The image type for each worker node must be Ubuntu.

== Supported apps

Project Astra supports all applications running on your Kubernetes clusters.

NetApp has validated some apps to ensure the safety and consistency of the snapshots and backups. link:/learn/validated-vs-standard.html[Learn the difference between Validated and Standard apps].

No matter which type of app that you use with Project Astra, you should always test the backup and restore workflow yourself to ensure that you can meet your disaster recovery requirements.
