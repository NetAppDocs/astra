Get started by verifying support for your Kubernetes clusters, apps, and web browser.

== Supported Kubernetes clusters

* The Astra beta program supports Kubernetes clusters that are managed by Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
+
On-prem Kubernetes clusters and clusters running in other cloud providers are not supported at this time.

* Clusters must be running in a healthy state, in one of the supported regions:

  ** us-central1 (Iowa)
  ** us-east4 (Virginia)
  ** us-west2 (LA)
  ** northamerica-northeast1 (Montreal)
  ** europe-west2 (London)
  ** europe-west3 (Frankfurt)
  ** europe-west4 (Netherlands)
  ** australia-southeast1 (Sydney)
  ** asia-southeast1 (Singapore)
  ** Other regions will be added in the future.

* A cluster must be running Kubernetes version 1.17 or later.

* The cluster must have at least one online worker node.

* The image type for each worker node must be Ubuntu.

* The cluster must reside on a VPC peered with the CVS-Performance service type (not the CVS service type).

* If the cluster is private, it must have the https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/private-cluster-concept[master authorized network] set to allow the Astra IP addresses:
  ** 18.232.241.74/32
  ** 52.72.239.237/32
  ** 3.210.60.146/32

== Supported apps

Astra supports all applications running on your Kubernetes clusters. link:../release-notes/known-limitations.html[Note that there is a known limitation with apps deployed from the Google Marketplace].

NetApp has validated some apps to ensure the safety and consistency of the snapshots and backups.

link:../learn/validated-vs-standard.html[Learn the difference between a Validated and a Standard app].

No matter which type of app that you use with Astra, you should always test the backup and restore workflow yourself to ensure that you can meet your disaster recovery requirements.

== Supported web browsers

Astra supports recent versions of Firefox, Safari, and Chrome with a minimum resolution of 1280 x 720.
