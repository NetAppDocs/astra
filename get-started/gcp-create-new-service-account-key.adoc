You can only view or download the Service Account key (JSON) file when you create the key. However, you can create a new key at any time.


== Create a New Service Account Key

Log in to the https://console.cloud.google.com[Google cloud console]. Click *IAM & Admin > Service Accounts*.

When you register a new cluster with Project Astra, find this `.json` file on your local workstation and upload it. You also have the option to open the file with a plaintext editor. Then copy and paste the contents of this key into the field of the registration workflow.

== Next Steps

Now that you have the JSON key file for your service account, you are ready to provision a new GKE cluster and add it to Project Astra. See our link:getting-started.html[Getting Started Guide] for instructions.
