Learn how to create a new service account using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) console in your browser.

For instructions on creating a new service account from the command line using the `gcloud` tool, please see link:gcp-create-service-account-gcloud.html[Create a New Service Account (gcloud)].

**Requirements**

* An active GCP account.
* A GCP project. link:gcp-create-project.html[Create a New GCP Project].

**External Resources**

To learn more about GCP service accounts, https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts[see the official Google Cloud documentation].

== Create a Service Account

Log in to the https://console.cloud.google.com/[Google Cloud Console] and go to *IAM and Admin > Service Accounts*. Click *+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT*.

Fill in the "Service account name" field. In the example below, the service account name is *astra-alpha*. The "Service account ID" field is automatically generated, but can be modified. You may add an optional service account description. Click *CREATE* to continue.

Next, grant this service account permissions for your project.

GCP has a large number of roles. Use the filter to quickly locate the ones you need for Project Astra. Click in the *Select a role* field and search for the role name you need. Click on the role to add it, then click *+ ADD ANOTHER ROLE* and repeat the process for each of the five required roles.

Project Astra requires the following roles:

* Compute Network Viewer
* Kubernetes Engine Admin
* NetApp Cloud Volumes Admin
* Service Usage Viewer
* Storage Admin

After you add all five roles, click **CONTINUE**. Click *DONE* to finish and return to the list of service accounts.

Find the service account you just created. Use the *Actions* menu at the end of the row to *Create key*. Leave the radio button set to JSON and click *CREATE*. This creates a JSON file for the service account and downloads the file to your computer.

NOTE: Don't be alarmed by the warning about not being able to recover the key file if lost. You can delete a "lost" key and generate a new one any time.

== Next Steps

Congratulations! You have successfully created a service account with the required roles and downloaded the JSON key file.

In the first step of the Project Astra Add Compute wizard, you will be prompted to find this `.json` file on your local workstation and upload it. See the link:getting-started.html[Getting Started Guide] for additional instructions.
