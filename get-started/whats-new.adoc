NetApp periodically updates Astra to bring you new features, enhancements, and bug fixes.

== 17 Dec 2020 update during Beta

We primarily focused on bug fixes to improve your experience, but we made a few other notable enhancements:

* When you add your first Kubernetes cluster to Astra, the object store is now created in the geography where the cluster resides.

* Details about persistent volumes is now available when you view storage details at the compute level.

* We added an option to restore an application from an existing snapshot or backup.

* If you delete a Kubernetes cluster that Astra is managing, the cluster now shows up in a *Removed* state. You can then remove the cluster from Astra.

* Account owners can now modify the assigned roles for other users.

* We added a section for billing, which will be enabled when Astra is released for General Availability (GA).
