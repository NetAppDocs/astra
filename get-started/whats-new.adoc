NetApp periodically updates Astra to bring you new features, enhancements, and bug fixes.

== 16 Dec 2020

We primarily focused on bug fixes to improve your experience, but we made a few other notable enhancements:

* Kubernetes clusters now show up in a *Removed* state, which enables you to remove a cluster if you deleted it while Astra was managing it.

* When you add your first Kubernetes cluster to Astra, the object store is now created in the geography where the cluster resides.

* Details about persistent volumes is now available at the Compute level.
