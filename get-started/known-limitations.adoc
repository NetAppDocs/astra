Known limitations identify platforms, devices, or functions that are not supported by this release of the product, or that do not interoperate correctly with it. Review these limitations carefully.

== Persistent volume limit

You can have up to 100 volumes per Google Cloud region. If you reach this limit, creation of new clones or volumes will fail.

== Unhealthy pods affect app management

If a managed app has pods in an unhealthy state, Project Astra can't create new backups and clones.

== Trident isn't uninstalled from a cluster

When you unmanage a cluster from Project Astra, Trident isn't uninstalled from the cluster. If you want to uninstall Trident, you'll need to https://netapp-trident.readthedocs.io/en/stable-v20.04/kubernetes/operations/tasks/managing.html#uninstalling-trident[follow these steps in the Trident documentation^].

== Existing connections to a Postgres pod causes failures

When you perform operations on Postgres pods, you shouldn't connect directly within the pod to use the psql command. Project Astra requires psql access to freeze and thaw the databases. If there is a pre-existing connection, the snapshot, backup, or clone will fail.
