To use the Project Astra beta program you will need to have a GCP project created with the correct APIs enabled. If you don't already have a GCP project, follow these steps to create a new one.

== Create a Project

Log in to the https://console.cloud.google.com[Google Cloud Console]. Click *Select a Project* on the top left navigation bar.

Fill in "Project Astra" as the Project name, select the organization you want to use, then click *CREATE* to create the project.

It may take a few moments for the project to be created. After the task is complete, you will be redirected to your dashboard.

== Enable APIs

Next, use the API Manager to enable the APIs used by Project Astra.. From the https://console.cloud.google.com[Google Cloud Console], click *APIs & Services > Dashboard*.
