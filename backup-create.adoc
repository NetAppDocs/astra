Learn how to create a remote backup of your application. This creates a recovery point for your app, in case of a failure.

NOTE: When you create a backup, you will not lose connection to the database. However, creating a backup will cause a temporary slowdown to your operations.

Click **Apps**, then click on the name of your app to select that cluster.

Fill out the details for your backup in the pop-up window. This defaults to a system-generated name for the backup. Click **Backup App** to continue to the second step.

Click **Backup App** to create the backup.

After the backup has finished being built, you can view it on the **Data Protection** tab for your cluster.
