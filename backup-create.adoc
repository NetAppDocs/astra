Learn how to create a remote backup of your application. This creates a recovery point for your app, in case of a failure.

NOTE: When you create a backup, you will not lose connection to the database. However, creating a backup may cause a temporary slowdown to your operations.

Click **Apps**, then click on the name of your app to select that cluster.

Click the **Available** menu on the right. Select **Backup** from the drop-down menu. If you have a pod in an unhealthy state, new backup operations cannot be performed on it.

Fill out the details for your backup in the pop-up window. This defaults to a system-generated name for the backup. Click **Backup App** to continue to the second step.

Click **Backup App** to create the backup.

NOTE: The first backup you create for a cluster will take substantially longer to build than subsequent backups. Future backups will take much less time to complete, due to the way they are processed.

After the backup has finished being built, you can view it on the **Data Protection** tab for your cluster.
