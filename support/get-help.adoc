NetApp provides support for the Project Astra beta program in a variety of ways. Extensive free self-support options are available 24x7, such as knowledgebase (KB) articles or a Slack channel. Your Project Astra account includes remote technical support via email, web ticketing, or phone.

You must first link:register-support.html[activate support for your NetApp serial number] in order to use these non self-service support options. A NetApp Support Site (NSS) SSO account is required for chat and web ticketing along with case management.

You can access support options from the Project Astra UI by selecting the *Support* tab from the main menu.
