Learn how to invite additional users to your Project Astra alpha program organization.

If you would like to invite additional users to see Project Astra, choose *Organization* from the left navigation menu. Then press the *+ Invite users* button.

There are two sections on the *Invite users* page. In the *USERS TO INVITE* section, provide the name and email address of the user you would like to invite. Multiple invitations can be sent simultaneously by using the *+ Add another user* button.

IMPORTANT: NetApp internal users only. When sending a Project Astra invitation to a netapp.com address, you have the choice to either send the invite to their sso@netapp.com or first.last@netapp.com email address.  Depending on which email is set for the user in the Auth0, NetApp internal users may be blocked by a blank page with the Project Astra logo. If this happens, remove the user and re-invite using their other email address.  

In the *ADD TO TEAM* section, press the button labeled *Not selected* in the *Status* column to select the team that the users should be invited to join. The button will toggle between *Not Selected* and *Selected*.

NOTE: Users cannot adjust their own team membership.  They will have to ask another user or contact support to perform that action.

Once you have at least one user to invite and one team selected, press the *Send invites* button in the lower right corner.

You will be returned to the *Organization* screen and see that your new user's details have been added with the *State* column showing as *Pending*.

If you want to cancel the invitation, change the *State* to *Remove user*.
