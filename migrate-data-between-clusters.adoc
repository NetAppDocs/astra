= Migrate Data Between Clusters
:imagesdir: assets/backups/

Migrating data between clusters is a two-step process:

1. Create a backup of the original cluster with the data you want to migrate.
2. Restore this backup to the destination cluster where you want to migrate the data.

To learn how to create a backup, see the article link:backup-create.html[Create a Backup].

To migrate data between clusters,  go to **Apps**. Click **Actions** for your app and select **Clone** from the drop-down menu.

Click **Review & Approve** to proceed to the final review step before restoring the app. Be sure the **original cluster** and **destination cluster** are correct. In this example, we are migrating data from `alpha-cluster-2` to `alpha-cluster-1`.

When you have verified that the details are correct, click **Clone App** to start the data migration. This launches the cloning process which will migrate your data from the original cluster to the new cluster.
