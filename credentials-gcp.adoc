To create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) cluster you will need to either create a new GCP project and credentials, or get the Service Account JSON data from your existing GCP project.

== Create a New Set of GCP Credentials

To create a new set of GCP credentials you will need to:

1. Create a new project.
2. Enable the Google Compute Engine API.
3. Create the credentials.

=== Create a New Project

Log into the https://console.cloud.google.com[Google Cloud Console]. Click **Select a Project** on the top left navigation bar.

Fill in "Astra" as the Project name, select the organization you want to use, then click **CREATE** to create the project.

It may take a few moments for the project to be created. After the task is complete, you will be redirected to your dashboard.

=== Enable the Google Compute Engine API

Next, use the API Manager to enable the Google Compute Engine API for this project. From the https://console.cloud.google.com[Google Cloud Console], click **APIs & Services > Dashboard**.

Next, grant this Service account permissions for your project. Select a role, then click **Continue** to continue.

When you register a new cluster with Project Astra, find this `.json` file in your Downloads folder and open it with a plaintext editor like Notepad. Copy and paste the contents of this key into the related field of the registration workflow.

== Find Your Existing GCE Credentials

You can only view or download the Service Account JSON file when you create the key. However, you can create a new key at any time.

=== Create a New GCE Service Account Key

Log in to the https://console.cloud.google.com[Google cloud console]. Click **IAM & Admin > Service Accounts**.
