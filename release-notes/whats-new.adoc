NetApp periodically updates Astra to bring you new features, enhancements, and bug fixes.

== 24 Feb 2021

Astra now supports the https://cloud.google.com/solutions/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/service-types[CVS service type^] with Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud. This is in addition to already supporting the CVS-Performance service type. Just as a reminder, Astra uses Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud as the backend storage for your persistent volumes.

This enhancement means that Astra can now manage app data for Kubernetes clusters that are running in _any_ https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions#cvsGcp[Google Cloud region where Cloud Volumes Service is supported^].

If you have the flexibility to choose between Google Cloud regions, then you can link:../learn/choose-class-and-size.html[pick either CVS or CVS-Performance depending on your performance requirements].

== 25 Jan 2021

We're pleased to announce that Astra is now Generally Available. We incorporated a lot of the feedback that we received from the Beta release and made a few other notable enhancements.

* Billing is now available, which enables you to move from the Free Plan to the Premium Plan. link:../use/set-up-billing.html[Learn more about billing].

* Astra now creates Persistent Volumes with a minimum size of 100 GiB.

* Astra can now discover apps faster.

* You can now create and delete accounts on your own.

* We've improved notifications when Astra can no longer access Kubernetes compute.
+
These notifications are important because Astra can't manage apps for disconnected compute.

== 17 Dec 2020 (Beta update)

We primarily focused on bug fixes to improve your experience, but we made a few other notable enhancements:

* When you add your first Kubernetes compute to Astra, the object store is now created in the geography where the cluster resides.

* Details about persistent volumes is now available when you view storage details at the compute level.

* We added an option to restore an application from an existing snapshot or backup.

* If you delete a Kubernetes cluster that Astra is managing, the cluster now shows up in a *Removed* state. You can then remove the cluster from Astra.

* Account owners can now modify the assigned roles for other users.

* We added a section for billing, which will be enabled when Astra is released for General Availability (GA).
