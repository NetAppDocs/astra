Known limitations identify platforms, devices, or functions that are not supported by this release of the product, or that do not interoperate correctly with it. Review these limitations carefully.

== Google Marketplace apps haven't been validated

NetApp hasn't validated apps that were deployed from the Google Marketplace. Some users report issues with discovery or backup of Postgres, MariaDB, and MySQL apps that were deployed from the Google Marketplace.

No matter which type of app that you use with Astra, you should always test the backup and restore workflow yourself to ensure that you can meet your disaster recovery requirements.

== One GCP project and one service account are supported

The Astra Beta program supports one Google Cloud Platform project and one service account. You should not add more than one service account to Astra and you shouldn’t rotate service account credentials.

If you want to change the GCP project that you’re using with Astra, then we will need to set up a new account for you.

We intend to address this limitation in a future release.

== Persistent volume limit

You can have up to 100 volumes per Google Cloud region. If you reach this limit, creation of new clones or volumes will fail. link:../support/get-help.html[Contact support to increase the volume limit].

== Unhealthy pods affect app management

If a managed app has pods in an unhealthy state, Astra can't create new backups and clones.

== Trident isn't uninstalled from a cluster

When you unmanage a cluster from Astra, Trident isn't automatically uninstalled from the cluster. To uninstall Trident, you'll need to https://netapp-trident.readthedocs.io/en/stable-v20.04/kubernetes/operations/tasks/managing.html#uninstalling-trident[follow these steps in the Trident documentation^].

== Existing connections to a Postgres pod causes failures

When you perform operations on Postgres pods, you shouldn't connect directly within the pod to use the psql command. Astra requires psql access to freeze and thaw the databases. If there is a pre-existing connection, the snapshot, backup, or clone will fail.
