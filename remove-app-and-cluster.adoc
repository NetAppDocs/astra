This ends your app being managed by Project Astra. It does not remove the app from your cluster.

This removes your cluster from Project Astra. It does not delete the GKE cluster from your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account.

== Optional: Delete the Cluster

To fully delete the cluster, log in to the https://console.cloud.google.com/[Google Cloud Console]. Go to  **Kubernetes Engine > Clusters**, then click **Delete** for the cluster you wish to delete.
