There are two types of applications you can bring to Astra: Validated and Standard. Learn the difference between these two categories, and the potential impacts on your projects and strategy.

NOTE: It's tempting to think of these two categories as "supported" and "unsupported." But as you will see, there is no such thing as an "unsupported" app in Astra. You can add any app to Astra, although validated apps have more infrastructure built around their Astra workflows compared to standard apps.

== Validated Apps

Validated apps for Astra include the following:

* MySQL 0.3.22
* MariaDB 14.14
* PostgreSQL 11.7
* Jenkins 2.249.1 LTS

The short list of validated apps represents applications that Astra recognizes. The Astra QA team has analyzed and confirmed these apps to be fully tested to restore.

NOTE: Applications deployed from Google Marketplace not been validated. Some users report issues with discovery and/or backup with Google Marketplace deployments of Postgres, MariaDB, and MySQL.

Validated apps have also been checked by the Astra Development team, which creates custom workflows to help ensure the safety and consistency of your data. For example, when Astra takes a backup of a PostgreSQL database, it first quiesces the database. After the backup is complete, Astra restores the database to normal operation.

No matter which type of app you use with Astra, always test the backup and restore workflow yourself to ensure that you can meet your disaster recovery requirements.

== Standard Apps

Any other app, including custom programs, is considered a standard app. You can add and manage standard apps through Astra. You can also create basic crash-consistent Snapshots and Backups of a standard app. However, these have not been QA-tested to restore the app to its original state.
