Remove any apps or clusters that you no longer want to manage from the Project Astra beta program.

== Stop managing an app

Stop managing apps that you no longer want to back up, snapshot, or clone from Project Astra.

.About this task

* This action stops your app from being managed by Project Astra. It doesn't remove the app from your cluster.

* Existing backups and snapshots aren't deleted, but data management operations aren't available from Project Astra.

* If you remove an app from your cluster, Project Astra will identify that it was removed, but the app remains in a managed state. That means you can still clone the app from a backup until you explicitly unmanage the app.

.Steps

. Click *Apps*.

. Click the checkbox for the apps that you no longer want to manage.

. Click the *Actions* drop-down and select *Unmanage application/s*.

. Confirm that you want to unmanage the apps and then click *Yes, Unmanage Apps*.

.Result

Project Astra stops managing the app.

== Stop managing clusters

Stop managing the clusters that you no longer want to manage from Project Astra.

.About this task

* This action stops your cluster from being managed by Project Astra. It doesn't make any changes to the cluster's configuration and it doesn't delete the cluster.

Trident won't be uninstalled from the cluster. https://netapp-trident.readthedocs.io/en/stable-v20.04/kubernetes/operations/tasks/managing.html#uninstalling-trident[Learn how to uninstall Trident^].

* Always remove your cluster from Project Astra before deleting it with the GCP console. Deleting the cluster from GCP first can cause problems with your Astra account.

* Apps associated with this cluster will no longer be managed and will go into a Detached state.

* Any snapshots or backups associated with applications on the cluster aren't deleted, but data management operations aren't available from Project Astra.

.Steps

. Delete any snapshots or backups and stop managing the cluster's applications before removing the cluster.

. Click the checkbox for the clusters that you no longer want to manage.

Project Astra stops managing the clusters.

== Cleaning up after the Beta

A few things remain after you've removed apps and clusters from Project Astra:

* The object store that was created in your Google Cloud account
* The Admin role that was installed on each managed Kubernetes cluster
* The service account that you created

You'll need to manually remove these.
