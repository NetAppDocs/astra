Remove any apps or clusters that you no longer want to manage from the Astra beta program.

== Stop managing an app

Stop managing apps that you no longer want to back up, snapshot, or clone from Astra.

.About this task

* This action stops your app from being managed by Astra. It doesn't remove the app from your cluster.

* Existing backups and snapshots aren't deleted, but data management operations aren't available from Astra.

* If you remove an app from your cluster, Astra will identify that it was removed, but the app remains in a managed state. That means you can still clone the app from a backup until you explicitly unmanage the app.

WARNING: Always remove a cluster from Astra before you delete it through GCP. Deleting a cluster from GCP while it's still being managed by Astra can cause problems for your Astra account.

.Steps

. Click *Apps*.

. Click the checkbox for the apps that you no longer want to manage.

. Click the *Actions* drop-down and select *Unmanage application/s*.

. Confirm that you want to unmanage the apps and then click *Yes, Unmanage Apps*.

.Result

Astra stops managing the app.

== Stop managing clusters

Stop managing the clusters that you no longer want to manage from Astra.

.About this task

* This action stops your cluster from being managed by Astra. It doesn't make any changes to the cluster's configuration and it doesn't delete the cluster.

* Any snapshots or backups associated with applications on the cluster aren't deleted, but data management operations aren't available from Astra.

== Cleaning up after the Beta

A few things remain after you've removed apps and clusters from Astra:

* The object store that was created in your Google Cloud account
* The Admin role that was installed on each managed Kubernetes cluster
* The service account that you created

You'll need to manually remove these.
