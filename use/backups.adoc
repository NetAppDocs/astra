Learn how to create, manage, and restore from backup.

== Create a Backup

Learn how to create a remote backup of your application. This creates a recovery point for your app, in case of a failure.

NOTE: When you create a backup, access to your application will remain available. However, creating a backup may cause a temporary slowdown for a short period of time.

Click **Apps**, then click on the name of your app.

Click the **Available** menu on the right. Select **Backup** from the drop-down menu. If you have a pod in an unhealthy state, new backup operations cannot be performed on it.

Provide the name of the backup. Otherwise, this will default to a system-generated name. Click **Backup App** to review the details for the backup.

Click **Backup App** to create the backup.

NOTE: The first backup you create for a cluster may take longer to complete than subsequent backups. Future backups will take much less time to complete. However, the time to complete a backup also depends on the amount of data being backed up, and how many changes have been made since the previous backup.

After the backup has finished, you can view it on the **Data Protection** tab for your cluster.

Learn how to find the backups for your app, arranged by timestamp.

Learn how to find the backups for your app, arranged by timestamp. Backups can be seen on the Data Protection tab for the relevant application as soon as they are created.

Click **Apps**, then click on the name of your app to select that cluster.
