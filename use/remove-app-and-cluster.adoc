After you are done exploring the functionality of the Project Astra beta program, you will want to remove your assets from the service.

== Deregister Your App(s)

Go to **Apps**, then click your app to select it. Click to expand the actions menu, then click **Deregister**.

This ends your app being managed by Project Astra. It does not remove the app from your cluster.

== Remove Your Cluster(s)

Go to **Compute**, then click your cluster to select it. Click to expand the actions menu, then click **Remove cluster**.

This removes your cluster from Project Astra. It does not delete the GKE cluster from your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account.

NOTE: It's important to remove your cluster from Astra before you delete it through the GCP console. Deleting the cluster from GCP first can cause problems with your Astra account.

== Optional: Delete the Cluster

To fully delete the cluster, log in to the https://console.cloud.google.com/[Google Cloud Console]. Go to  **Kubernetes Engine > Clusters**, then click **Delete** for the cluster you wish to delete.
