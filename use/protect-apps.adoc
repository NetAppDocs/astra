Protect your apps by taking snapshots and backups using an automated protection policy or on an ad-hoc basis.

== Snapshots and backups

A _snapshot_ is a point-in-time copy of an app that's stored on the same provisioned volume as the app. They are usually fast. Local snapshots are used to restore the application to an earlier point in time.

A _backup_ is stored on object storage. A backup can be slower to take compared to the local snapshots. However, they can be accessed across regions in the cloud. Backups are used for migrating applications across cloud regions. Also, you can choose to have a longer retention period for backups.

== Configure a protection policy

Configure a protection policy to protect an app by creating snapshots, backups, or both at a defined schedule and with a specified number of copies to retain.

.Steps

. Click *Apps* and then click the name of an app.

. Click *Data Protection*.

. Click *Configure Protection Policy*.

. Define a protection schedule by choosing the number of snapshots and backups to keep hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly.
+
You can define the hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly schedules concurrently. A schedule won't turn active until you set a retention level.
+
The following example sets a schedule to take snapshots daily and weekly, while retaining the last 14 hourly snapshots and the last 26 weekly snapshots. It also takes monthly backups and retains the last 12 copies. Because 0 copies were selected for hourly, no hourly snapshots or backups are taken.

. Click *Review Information*.

. Click *Set Protection Policy.*

.Result

Project Astra implements the data protection policy by creating and retaining snapshots and backups using the schedule and retention policy that you defined.

== Create a snapshot

. Review the backup summary and click *Backup App*.

.Result

Project Astra creates a backup of the app.
