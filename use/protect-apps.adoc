Protect your apps by taking snapshots and backups using an automated protection policy or on an ad-hoc basis.

== Configure a protection policy

Configure a protection policy to protect an app by creating snapshots, backups, or both at a defined schedule and with a specified number of copies to retain.

. Define a protection schedule by choosing the number of snapshots and backups to keep hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly.
+
You can define the hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly schedules concurrently. A schedule won't turn active until you set a retention level.
+
The following sample policy sets a schedule to take snapshots daily and weekly, while retaining the last 14 hourly snapshots and the last 26 weekly snapshots. It also takes backups and retains the last 12 copies. Because 0 copies were selected for hourly, no hourly snapshots or backups are taken.
