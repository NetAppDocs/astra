Learn how to use the Clone functionality to clone from current state, clone from snapshot, clone from backup, and use Clone to migrate data to a different cluster.

== Use Clone to Migrate Data

Migrating data between clusters is a two-step process:

1. Create a backup of the original cluster with the data you want to migrate.
2. Use Clone to restore this backup to the destination cluster where you want to migrate the data.

To learn how to create a backup, see the article link:backup-create.html[Create a Backup].

To migrate data between clusters,  go to **Apps**. Click **Actions** for your app and select **Clone** from the drop-down menu.

In the pop-up window which appears, click the **From backup or snapshot** tab.

Choose a name for your clone operation, and select the destination cluster. This is the cluster where you want to migrate the data. In this example, we are migrating data to `alpha-cluster-1`.

Click to select **Backup** as the clone source.

Select the source backup with the data you wish to migrate. To choose the source backup, click **Not selected** to toggle to **Selected**.

Click **Review & Approve** to proceed to the final review step before restoring the app. Be sure the **original cluster** and **destination cluster** are correct. In this example, we are migrating data from `alpha-cluster-2` to `alpha-cluster-1`.

When you have verified that the details are correct, click **Clone App** to start the data migration. This launches the cloning process which will migrate your data from the original cluster to the new cluster.
