After you link:../get-started/add-first-cluster.html[add a Kubernetes cluster to Astra], you can install apps on that cluster (outside of Astra), and then go to the Apps page in Astra to start managing the apps.

== Install apps on your cluster

Now that you've added your Kubernetes cluster to Astra, you can install apps on the cluster. Persistent volumes will be provisioned on the new storage classes by default. After the pods are online, you can manage the app with Astra.

Astra will manage stateful apps only if the storage is on a storage class installed by Astra: netapp-cvs-extreme, netapp-cvs-premium, or netapp-cvs-standard.

For help with deploying common applications from Helm charts, refer to the following:

== Manage apps

Astra enables you to manage your apps at the namespace level or by Kubernetes label.

=== Manage apps by namespace

The *Discovered* section of the Apps page shows namespaces and any Helm-installed apps. You can choose to manage each app individually or at the namespace level. It all comes down to the level of granularity that you need for data protection operations.

For example, you might want to set a backup policy for "maria" that has a weekly cadence, but you might need to back up "mariadb" (which is in the same namespace) more frequently than that. Based on those needs, you would need to manage the apps separately and not under a single namespace.

.Steps

. Click *Apps* and then click *Discovered*.

. Look at the *Group* column to see which namespace the application is running in (it's designated with the folder icon) and whether any Helm labels are available (those are designated with a tag icon).
+
Here's an example:
+

. Click the drop-down list in the *Actions* column for the desired app and click *Manage*.
+

. If you don't want to manage an app, click the drop-down list in the *Actions* column for the desired app and click *Ignore*.
+
For example, if you wanted to manage all apps under the "maria" namespace together so that they have the same snapshot and backup policies, you would manage the first app and ignore the second app:

.Result

Apps that you chose to manage are now available from the *Managed* tab. Any ignored apps will move to the *Ignored* tab. Ideally, the Discovered tab will show zero apps, so that as new apps are installed, they are easier to find and manage.

=== Manage apps by Kubernetes label

Astra includes an action at the top of the Apps page named *Define custom app*. You can use this action to manage apps that are identified with a Kubernetes label. link:../learn/define-custom-app.html[Learn more about defining apps by Kubernetes label].

.Steps

. Click *Apps > Define custom app*.

. In the *Define Custom Application* dialog box, provide the required information to manage the app:

.. *New App*: Enter the display name of the app.

.. *Compute*: Select the compute where the app resides.

.. *Namespace:* Select the namespace for the app.

.. *Label:* Enter a label or select a label from the resources below.

.. *Selected Resources*: View and manage the selected Kubernetes resources that you'd like to protect (pods, secrets, persistent volumes, and more).
+
Here's an example:
+

+
** View the available labels by expanding a resource and clicking the number of labels.
+
image:screenshot-view-labels.gif[]
+
** Select one of the labels.
+

+
After you choose a label, it displays in the *Label* field. Astra also updates the *Unselected Resources* section to show the resources that don't match the selected label.

.. *Unselected Resources*: Verify the app resources that you don't want to protect.
+

. Click *Define Custom App*.

.Result

Astra enables management of the app. You can now find it in the *Managed* tab.

== What about system apps?

Astra also discovers the system apps running on a Kubernetes cluster. You can view them by filtering the Apps list.

We don't show you these system apps by default because it's rare that you'd need to back them up.
