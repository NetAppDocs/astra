Astra's Free Plan enables you to manage up to 10 apps in your account. If you want to manage more than 10 apps, then you'll need to set up billing by upgrading from the Free Plan to the Premium Plan.

== Billing overview

Astra offers two plans:

* *Free Plan*: Manage up to 10 apps for free.
* *Premium Plan*: Manage an unlimited amount of apps by paying per minute, per application.

When you create an Astra account, you're automatically signed up for the Free Plan. Astra's Dashboard shows you how many apps you're currently managing out of the 10 free apps that you're allowed:

When you try to manage an 11th app, Astra notifies you that you've reached the limit of the Free Plan. It then prompts you to upgrade from the Free Plan to the Premium Plan.

* Your billing plan is per Astra account.
+
If you have multiple accounts, then each has its own billing plan.

* Your Astra bill includes charges for managing your Kubernetes apps. Youâ€™re charged separately by your cloud provider for the backend storage for persistent volumes.
