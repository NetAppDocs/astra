Astra Control's Free Plan enables you to manage up to 10 apps in your account. If you want to manage more than 10 apps, then you'll need to set up billing by upgrading from the Free Plan to the Premium Plan.

== Billing overview

Astra Control offers three plans:

Free Plan:: Manage up to 10 apps for free.
Premium PayGo:: Manage an unlimited amount of apps at a rate of $.005 per minute, per app.
Premium Subscription:: Pre-pay at a discounted rate with an annual subscription that enables you to manage up to 10 apps per _application pack_. Contact NetApp Sales to purchase as many packs as needed for your organization--for example, purchase 3 packs to manage 30 apps from Astra Control. If you manage more apps than allowed by your annual subscription, then you'll be charged at the overage rate of $0.005 per minute, per application (the same as Premium PayGo).
+
If you don't have an Astra Control account yet, purchasing the Premium Subscription automatically creates an Astra Control account for you. If you have an existing Free Plan, then you're automatically converted to the Premium Subscription.

When you create an Astra Control account, you're automatically signed up for the Free Plan. Astra Control's Dashboard shows you how many apps you're currently managing out of the 10 free apps that you're allowed:

When you try to manage an 11th app, Astra Control notifies you that you've reached the limit of the Free Plan. It then prompts you to upgrade from the Free Plan to a Premium Plan.
