Add and remove cloud provider credentials from your account at any time. The Project Astra beta program uses these credentials to discover clusters, apps on a cluster, and to provision resources on your behalf.

Note that all users in Project Astra share the same sets of credentials.

== Add credentials

The most common way to add credentials to Project Astra is when you add a cluster, but you can also add credentials from the Account page. The credentials will then be available to choose when you add your next Kubernetes cluster.

.What you'll need

You should have the service account key file for a service account that has the required permissions. link:../get-started/set-up-google-cloud.html[Learn more].

.Steps

. Click *Account > Credentials*.

. Click *Add Credentials*.

. Enter a name for the credentials that distinguishes them from other credentials in Project Astra.

. Provide the Google Cloud service account key file either by uploading the file or by pasting the contents from your clipboard.

. Click *Add credentials*.

.Result

The credentials are now available to select when you add a Kubernetes cluster to Project Astra.

== Remove credentials

An Account Owner can remove credentials from the account at any time.

.Steps

. Click *Account > Credentials*.

. Click the drop-down list in the *State* column for the credentials that you want to remove.

. Click *Remove*.
