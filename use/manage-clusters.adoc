Add new clusters to Project Astra to enable application data management.

== Add new clusters

Add a GKE cluster to Project Astra to start managing data for the cluster.

.Steps

. On the Dashboard, click *Add a Kubernetes Cluster*.

. *Step 1: Provider*: Specify the credentials that you'd like to use to discover your clusters:
+
* To use a service account that you haven't added to Project Astra yet, provide the service account key file either by choosing *Upload file* or *Paste from Clipboard*.

* To use a service account that you've already added to Project Astra, choose *Use existing* and then select the service account that you'd like to use.

. Click *Discover clusters*.
+
Project Astra uses the service account to discover the clusters running in the Google Kubernetes Engine projects that are associated with the service account.

. *Step 2: Compute*: Select the cluster that you'd like to add and click *Configure storage*.

. *Step 3: Storage*: Select the default storage class that you'd like to use with this cluster and click *Review information*.
+
Each storage class utilizes https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-service-for-gcp[Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud^].

. *Step 4: Review & Approve*: Review the configuration details and click *Add compute*.

.Result

Project Astra creates an object store for the cluster where backups are stored, creates an admin account on the cluster, and sets the default storage class that you specified. This process takes up to 5 minutes.

== View details about a cluster

After you add a cluster to Project Astra, you can view details about the cluster, such as its location, the worker nodes, persistent volumes, and storage classes.

.Steps

. Click *Compute*.

. Click the name of a cluster.

. View the information in the *Overview* and *Storage* tabs to find the information that you're looking for.

== Stop managing clusters

Stop managing the clusters that you no longer want to manage from Project Astra.

.About this task

* This action stops your cluster from being managed by Project Astra. It doesn't make any changes to the cluster's configuration and it doesn't delete the cluster.
+
Trident won't be uninstalled from the cluster.

* Apps associated with this cluster will no longer be managed and will go into a Detached state.

* Any snapshots or backups associated with applications on the cluster aren't deleted, but data management operations aren't available from Project Astra.

.Steps

. Delete any snapshots or backups and stop managing the cluster's applications before removing the cluster.

. Click the checkbox for the clusters that you no longer want to manage.

. Click the *Actions* drop-down and select *Unmanage cluster/s*.

. Confirm that you want to unmanage the clusters by typing the cluster name and then click *Yes, Unmanage Compute*.

.Result

Project Astra stops managing the cluster.
