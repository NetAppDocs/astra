= Work With MySQL/MariaDB on Astra
:hardbreaks:
:icons: font

This guide focuses on Helm as the preferred way to deploy Postgres apps. Plain YAML and Operator-based deployments may be covered in future guides.

For express instructions on launching MySQL/MariaDB on Astra, see link:mariadb-deploy-from-helm-chart.html[Deploy MySQL/MariaDB from a Helm Chart].

MariaDB and MySQL are validated apps for the Astra Beta program. link:../learn/validated-vs-standard.html[Learn the difference between Validated and Standard apps]

NOTE: MySQL 0.3.22 and MariaDB 14.14 are the only versions supported in the Astra Beta program.

== Requirements

In order to deploy MySQL/MariaDB from a Helm chart on a cluster registered with the Astra Beta program, you will need the following:

**GKE Cluster**

An up-to-date Kubernetes cluster (version 1.17+) which is connected to Astra. For help creating your GKE cluster and connecting it to Astra, see the link:../get-started/set-up-google-cloud.html[Getting Started Guide].

**Kubectl**

Kubectl is a standard tool for interacting with Kubernetes. For more information, see the guide https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[Install and Set Up kubectl^] in the official Kubernetes documentation.

**Kubeconfig**

The Kubeconfig file contains the credentials which let kubectl communicate with your Kubernetes cluster. to learn how to download your GKE Kubeconfig file, see the Google Cloud guide for https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl#generate_kubeconfig_entry[configuring cluster access for kubectl^].

**Cloud Volume Serivice in Google Cloud Platform (CVS-GCP)**

CVS is  the storage layer and connective elements for Astra, respectively. More details on how to configure CVS on GCP may be found in the https://cloud.google.com/solutions/partners/netapp-cloud-volumes/workflow[workflow guide for CVS]^.

**Helm (v3)**

Helm is a popular way to organize and install apps on Kubernetes. To install Helm on your local computer, follow https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[their handy install guide^].

=== MySQL/MariaDB Requirements

For a MySQL/MariaDB application, Astra requires:

* `global.storageClass` value to be set to the storageClass representing either CVS or Trident (or, that storageClass is set as your cluster's default provisioner).

== Install MariaDB/MySQL

For the Astra beta, we recommend the custom Helm chart we have created for this purpose. For instructions on how to deploy from this custom chart, see link:mariadb-deploy-from-helm-chart.html[Deploy MySQL/MariaDB from a Helm Chart].

The values need to be set to consume the volumes provisioned by CVS, be deployed in a namespace other than default, and your stateful app needs to be available to Astra.

By default the Bitnami chart uses a cluster's default storage class. Kubernetes clusters registered with Astra beta use Trident CSI fron NetApp. Trident  automatically sets CVS as the default storage class. Use `kubectl get sc` to see what your cluster's storageClasses are. This produces output like the following:

----
NAME                           PROVISIONER             RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE   ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE
netapp-cvs-extreme             csi.trident.netapp.io   Delete          Immediate           true                   26h
netapp-cvs-premium (default)   csi.trident.netapp.io   Delete          Immediate           true                   26h
netapp-cvs-standard            csi.trident.netapp.io   Delete          Immediate           true                   26h
standard                       kubernetes.io/gce-pd    Delete          Immediate           true                   27h
----

You have two options for changing settings in your `values.yaml`. The first option is to open the file and edit it directly. The second option is to add an extra argument to your usual Helm CLI command.

To view and export `values.yaml`, use the `helm show` command:

----
# mariaDB
helm show values bitnami/mariadb
# mySQL
helm show values bitnami/mysql
----

or

----
# mariaDB
helm show values bitnami/mariadb > my-values.yaml
# mySQL
helm show values bitnami/mysql > my-values.yaml
----

This creates a `my-values.yaml` file in your local directory. That file is a copy of the official `values.yaml`.

== Dry Run

Before deploying, you can do a dry run to make sure everything is set up correctly.

To do this, edit the values in the `my-values.yaml` file you created in the previous step. Test your deployment using the `-f my-values.yaml` and `--dry-run` flags:

----
# MariaDB
helm install -f my-values.yaml --namespace testdb --generate-name bitnami/mariadb --dry-run

# MySQL
helm install -f my-values.yaml --namespace testdb --generate-name bitnami/mysql --dry-run
----

If the output from our dry run looks correct, we may deploy to your cluster by removing `--dry-run`.

Before we can run the helm charts for real, you can choose to use an existing namespace or specify to create a new namespace with helm command like below;
----
# MariaDB
helm install -f my-values.yaml --namespace testdb --generate-name bitnami/mariadb --create-namespace

# MySQL
 helm install -f my-values.yaml --namespace testdb --generate-name bitnami/mysql --create-namespace
----

After deploying the application using Helm chart Astra will be automatically discover the application. After a successful discovery you can manage the app with Astra.
