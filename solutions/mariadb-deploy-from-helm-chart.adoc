Learn how to deploy MariaDB from the Bitnami Helm chart so that you can test the Astra beta program. After you deploy MariaDB on your cluster, you can manage the application with Astra.

MariaDB is a validated app for the Astra Beta program. link:../learn/validated-vs-standard.html[Learn the difference between Validated and Standard apps].

NOTE: Applications deployed from Google Marketplace have not been validated. Some users report issues with discovery and/or backup with Google Marketplace deployments of Postgres, MariaDB, and MySQL.

== Requirements

* A GKE cluster which has been added to Astra.
* Updated versions of Helm (version 3.2+) and Kubectl installed.
* Kubeconfig configured using the gcloud tool with a command like `gcloud container clusters get-credentials my-cluster-name`

== Install MariaDB

Two important notes on this process:

* You must deploy your app after the cluster is added to Astra, not before.
* You must deploy the Helm chart in a namespace other than the default.

Add the Bitnami chart repo:

----
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
----

Deploy MariaDB with the command:

----
helm install mariadb bitnami/mariadb --namespace testdb --create-namespace --set db.database=test_db,db.user=test_db_user,db.password=NKhjs2wQPt8 > /dev/null 2>&1
----

This does the following:

* Creates the `testdb` namespace.
* Deploys MariaDB on the `testdb` namespace.
* Creates a database named `test_db`
* Creates a user `test_db_user` with password `NKhjs2wQPt8`

WARNING: This method of setting the password at deployment is insecure. We do not recommend this for a production environment.

After the pods are online, you can manage the app with Astra. Astra allows you to manage an app at the namespace level or using a helm label
