Learn how to exercise the Astra Beta program workflow by deploying MariaDB from a Helm chart. After you deploy MariaDB on your cluster, you can manage the application with Astra.

MariaDB is a validated app for the Astra Beta program. link:../learn/validated-vs-standard.html[Learn the difference between Validated and Standard apps].

NOTE: The Astra Beta program only supports MySQL 0.3.22 and MariaDB 14.14.

== System Requirements

In order to deploy MariaDB from a Helm chart for the Astra Beta program, you need the following:

* A GKE cluster which has been added to Astra.
* Updated versions of Helm (version 3.2+) and Kubectl installed.
* Kubeconfig configured using the gcloud tool with a command like `gcloud container clusters get-credentials my-cluster-name`

NOTE: Applications deployed from Google Marketplace not been validated. Some users report issues with discovery and/or backup with Google Marketplace deployments of Postgres, MariaDB, and MySQL.

== Install MariaDB

To exercise the Astra Beta program workflow, we recommend you use the Helm chart.

Deploy MariaDB with the command:

----
helm install mariadb bitnami/mariadb --namespace testdb --create-namespace --set db.database=test_db,db.user=test_db_user,db.password=NKhjs2wQPt8 > /dev/null 2>&1
----

This does the following:

* Creates the `testdb` namespace.
* Deploys MariaDB on the `testdb` namespace.
* Creates a database named `test_db`
* Creates a user `test_db_user` with password `NKhjs2wQPt8`

WARNING: This method of setting the password at deployment is insecure. Only use this command when setting up MariaDB for a sandbox deployment to use Astra Beta program. We do not recommend this for a production environment.

After the Helm chart is deployed, it will be automatically discovered by Astra, at which point you can manage the app with Astra.
