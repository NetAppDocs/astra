== Provision a Cluster Using GKE

Evaluating Project Astra requires one or more GKE clusters. There are multiple ways to provision a cluster that will work with Project Astra. This is one method using the Google Cloud Platform web UI.

Log into the https://console.cloud.google.com[Google Cloud Platform Console]

Please confirm that you have the correct project selected. The current project is highlighted in yellow in the image below.

image::gcp-gke-dashboard.png[GCP GKE Dashboard]

Use the left navigation menu to choose *Kubernetes Engine->Clusters*

Use the *+Create Cluster* link to start configuring a GKE cluster.

image::gcp-gke-cluster-basics.png[GCP GKE Cluster Basics]

Give your cluster a name or accept the supplied value.

In order to access GCP CVS, the cluster must be provisioned one of these zones.

* us-east4
* us-central1
* us-west2

The location should remain set to *Zonal*. Make a selection under "Location type" by choosing your preferred *Zone* from the drop-down.

Project Astra utilizes features that are only available in Kubernetes v1.17 and higher. As of this writing, Kubernetes 1.17 is not available as a selectable option in the default "Static version" drop-down menu.

In the "Master version" section, activate the *Release channel* radio button and then choose *Rapid channel-1.17.5-gke-0*. The exact value will change as Google deploys new releases of Kubernetes.

Using the left navigation menu, expand *default-pool* under "NODE POOLS" and select *Nodes*.

image::gcp-gke-nodes.png[GCP GKE Nodes]

Under "Image type" select *Ubuntu*.

You are welcome to adjust the other values as you see fit. The defaults should work fine for evaluating Project Astra.

TIP: Before hitting the "CREATE" button, you may want to switch to the "Metadata" section (under CLUSTER, not NODE POOLS) and add one or more labels to this cluster.

image::gcp-gke-metadata-labels.png[GCP GKE Metadata Labels]

In the example image, a label has been added with `creator` as the key.

When you are done with the configuration, press the *CREATE* button to continue.

Once the cluster has been provisioned it will appear in the list.

== Register the Cluster with Project Astra

For best results, please use the Chrome browser when evaluating Project Astra.

You will be invited into a Project Astra organization by an existing user.

The invitation will come via e-mail and contains a link. You'll need to have avalid https://cloud.netapp.com[Cloud Central] account matching the e-mailaddress that was invited in order to accept.

Project Astra is available at https://preview.astra.netapp.com during the Alpha phase.

When logged in you will see the dashboard.

image::astra-welcome-dashboard.png[Astra Welcome Dashboard]

Use the left navigation menu to select *Compute* under *DATA*. You may see a list of Kubernetes clusters that are already registered with Project Astra. Click the *+ Add cluster* button to begin the cluster registration process.

image::astra-compute-add-cluster.png[Astra Compute Add Cluster]

The default provider is set to "Google Cloud Platform." Microsoft Azure and AWS will be enabled at a future date.

image::astra-select-provider.png[Astra Select Provider]

"Service account JSON" is generated in the GCP console IAM section. If you have it saved as a file, use the first "Upload file" option. Otherwise, choose "Paste from Clipboard" or "Use existing."

"Service account name" will be automatically generated based on the `client_email` value contained in the service account JSON. You may change it if you wish. This value will appear under "Use existing" to identify the available service account credentials.

Press the *Discover clusters* button to continue. You will see a list of Kubernetes clusters that are currently provisioned.
