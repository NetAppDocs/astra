image::invitation-welcome-dashboard.png[Welcome Dashboard]

=== Invite Someone to Project Astra

If you would like to invite additional users to see Project Astra, choose *Organization* from the left navigation menu. Then press the *+ Invite users* button.

image::invite-organization.png[Invite Organization]

There are two sections on the *Invite users* page. In the *USERS TO INVITE* section, provide the name and email address of the user you would like to invite. Multiple invitations can be sent simultaneously by using the *+ Add another user* button.

image::invite-users.png[Invite Users]

In the *ADD TO TEAM* section, press the button labeled *Not selected* in the *Status* column to select the team that the users should be invited to join. The button will toggle between *Not Selected* and *Selected*.

image::invite-select-team.png[Select Team]

Once you have at least one user to invite and one team selected, press the *Send invite/s* button in the lower right corner.

You will be returned to the *Organization* screen and see that your new user's details have been added with the *State* column showing as *Pending*.

image::invitation-pending.png[Invitation Pending]

If you want to cancel the invitation, change the *State* to *Remove user*.

image::invitation-pending-remove.png[Invitation Pending Remove]

You will be prompted to type the name of the user. Then press the red *Yes, Remove User* button to complete the removal request.

== Provision a Cluster Using GKE

Evaluating Project Astra requires one or more GKE clusters. There are multiple ways to provision a cluster that will work with Project Astra. First we will demonstrate one method using the Google Cloud Platform console.

Log into the https://console.cloud.google.com[Google Cloud Platform Console]

Please confirm that you have the correct project selected. The current project
is highlighted in yellow in the image below.

image::gcp-gke-dashboard.png[GCP GKE Dashboard]

Use the left navigation menu to choose **Kubernetes Engine->Clusters**

Use the "+Create Cluster" link to start configuring a GKE cluster.

image::gcp-gke-cluster-basics.png[GCP GKE Cluster Basics]

Give your cluster a name or accept the supplied value.

In order to access GCP CVS, the cluster must be provisioned one of these zones.

* us-east4
* us-central1
* us-west2

The location should remain set to *Zonal*. Make a selection under "Location type" by choosing your preferred *Zone* from the drop-down.

Project Astra utilizes features that are only available in Kubernetes v1.17 and
higher. As of this writing, Kubernetes 1.17 is not available as a selectable option in the default "Static version" drop-down menu.

In the "Master version" section, activate the *Release channel* radio button and
then choose *Rapid channel-1.17.5-gke-0*. The exact value will change as Google
deploys new releases of Kubernetes.

Using the left navigation menu, expand *default-pool* under "NODE POOLS" and
select *Nodes*.

image::gcp-gke-nodes.png[GCP GKE Nodes]

Under "Image type" select *Ubuntu*.

You are welcome to adjust the other values as you see fit. The defaults should
work fine for evaluating Project Astra.

NOTE: Before hitting the "CREATE" button, you may want to switch to the "Metadata"
section (under CLUSTER, not NODE POOLS) and add one or more labels to this
cluster.

image::gcp-gke-metadata-labels.png[GCP GKE Metadata Labels]

In the example image, a label has been added with `creator` as the key.

When you are done with the configuration, press the *CREATE* button to continue.

Once the cluster has been provisioned it will appear in the list.

image::gcp-gke-clusters.png[GCP GKE Clusters]

=== Create a Cluster Using `gcloud`

Consider providing instructions to use `gcloud` for cluster creation instead of the GUI. *EJK - Maybe this should be broken out to another section/document?*

== Retrieve and Modify the Cluster Kubeconfig

Pressing the *Connect* button on the right side of the line containing your
cluster will open a window containing instructions on how to get a kubeconfig
file for accessing the cluster. This file will need to be modified and can then
used to register the cluster with Project Astra.

image::gcp-gke-connect-gcloud.png[GCP GKE Connect Gcloud]

The `gcloud` CLI (Command Line Interface) tool will be used.

(*EJK - maybe there is an easier way?*)

Quickstart guides for installing and configuring `gcloud` are available from
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts[Google Cloud Docs]

(*EJK - do we want to provide per OS instructions?*)

=== MacOS

The following steps are one method for generating a kubeconfig file compatible with Project Astra.

Enter the following into a command prompt:

`curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash`

Restart your shell

Run `gcloud init` in the command prompt to initialize the gcloud environment.

If you are using zsh then you can set your local environment variable like this:

`export KUBECONFIG=/Users/username/path/cluster-name.yaml`

Verify that the file was populated.

`echo $KUBECONFIG`

`cat /Users/username/path/cluster-name.yaml`

Then run the `gcloud` command which will write out the config for the cluster to
the file specified above.

Create your service account token by running `make_sa_token_kubeconfig.sh`.

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash


CLUSTER=$(kubectl config view --flatten --minify -o=jsonpath='{range .clusters[*]}{.name}')
echo Cluster: $CLUSTER
CERT_AUTH_DATA=$(kubectl config view --flatten --minify -o=jsonpath='{range .clusters[*]}{.cluster.certificate-authority-data}')
echo Cert Auth Data: $CERT_AUTH_DATA
SERVER=$(kubectl config view --flatten --minify -o=jsonpath='{range .clusters[*]}{.cluster.server}')
echo Server: $SERVER

*EJK-what do we do for Windows users?*


You will end up with a `kubeconfig.yaml` file that will be used when registering
the cluster with Project Astra. Here is a slightly redacted sample.

```

== Register the Cluster with Project Astra

For best results, please use the Chrome browser.

You will be invited into a Project Astra organization by an existing user.

The invitation will come via e-mail and contains a link. You'll need to have a
valid https://cloud.netapp.com[Cloud Central] account matching the e-mail
address that was invited in order to accept.

Project Astra is available at https://preview.astra.netapp.com during the Alpha
phase.

When logged in you are greeted with the dashboard.

image::astra-credentials-add-new.png[Astra Credentials Add New]

"GCP Credential" is whatever name you want to identify the service account
credentials that are being provided below.

Service Account JSON - this is generated in the GCP console IAM section.

*EJK - Add or link to instructions for this*

Region is the location you provisioned the GKE cluster in. Select from the
drop-down.

Project number is a twelve-digit numeric value that is associated with your
project. Google provides additional details at
https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects.

You can also use `gcloud` to locate the project number.

`gcloud projects list`

"Select Compute" will take you to the next section where you will provide the
modified kubeconfig, etc.
