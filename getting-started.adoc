:imagesdir: assets/getting-started/

This document is intended for users that are evaluating Project Astra during the
alpha phase. 

== Requirements

This is a quick summary of the steps to get up and running with Project Astra.

* Register with Cloud Central.
* Get invited to an Astra Organization.
* Setup a GCP (Google Compute Platform) account and/or Project.
** Grant required Service Account permissions.
** Generate a GCP Service Account key (JSON).
** Configure Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud.
* Provision two or more GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) clusters.
** Select Kubernetes version >= 1.17.0 from the Rapid Release Channel.
** Use Ubuntu worker nodes.
** Choose a "Zonal" location type in a Cloud Volumes Service supported region. (i.e., us-west2-a, us-central1-b)
* Provision some applications and then create snapshots, backups, and clones.

NOTE: Chrome is the only supported browser for the Project Astra alpha program.

== Register with Cloud Central

If you don't have an account registered at https://cloud.netapp.com/home[NetApp Cloud Central] yet, you will need to create one before you begin using Project Astra.

Go to https://cloud.netapp.com/home[NetApp Cloud Central]. Accept the notice regarding browser cookies, then click *SIGN UP*.

This redirects you to https://netapp-cloud-account.auth0.com[NetApp Cloud Account at Auth0]. Complete the required form fields and review the terms and conditions, then click *SIGN UP* to create your NetApp Cloud Central account.

=== Verify Email Address

If you already have an account, click **User Settings** to verify your registration email address.

IMPORTANT: Provide this exact email address to whomever is inviting you to Project Astra.

=== Invitation to Preview Project Astra

Your invitation to preview Project Astra will arrive by email.

Click *Join Now* to accept the invitation. This launches a browser window for Project Astra. Click **Accept Invitation** to accept the invitation and be redirected to the Project Astra dashboard.

== Provision a Cluster Using GKE

NOTE: Private Kubernetes clusters are not supported in the Project Astra alpha program. Only publicly-available Kubernetes clusters will work.

To evaluate Project Astra, you need two or more GKE clusters. There are multiple ways to provision a cluster that will work with Project Astra. This method uses the Google Cloud Platform web UI.

WARNING: The free introductory tier for Google Cloud Platform only allows you to create one Kubernetes cluster at a time, among other limitations.

Log into the https://console.cloud.google.com[Google Cloud Platform Console]

Confirm that you have selected the correct project.

image::gcp-gke-dashboard.png[GCP GKE Dashboard]

Go to *Kubernetes Engine > Clusters*. Click *+Create Cluster* to create a new cluster.

Project Astra requires the following:

* **Location type** set to **Zonal** and provisioned in a https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions[region supported] by the Cloud Volumes Service, such as:
  * us-east-4
  * us-central-1
  * us-west-2
* Kubernetes version 1.17 or higher
* Image type: Ubuntu

To set the Kubernetes version, click **Master Version: Release channel**. Select *Rapid channel-1.17.5-gke-0*.

image::gcp-gke-cluster-basics.png[GCP GKE Cluster Basics]

To set the image type, click **NODE POOLS: default-pool** on the left. For **Image type** set **Ubuntu**.

image::gcp-gke-nodes.png[GCP GKE Nodes]

Adjust the other values as you see fit.

NOTE: Custom networks are not supported in the Project Astra alpha program. Only the default VPC will work.

The remaining defaults should work fine for evaluating Project Astra.

TIP: For the alpha program, we recommend `n1-standard-2` as a minimum instance size. This reduces the chance you will encounter issues due to unexpected resource contention.

When you are done with the configuration, click *CREATE* to continue.

Once the cluster has been provisioned it will appear in the list.

== Register the Cluster with Project Astra

Log in to https://astra.netapp.com[Project Astra]. The first time you log in you'll be notified to accept cookies.

click **DATA: Compute**.

image::astra-welcome-dashboard.png[Astra Welcome Dashboard]

Click *+ Add compute* to start the cluster registration process.

image::astra-compute-add-cluster-empty.png[Astra Compute Add Cluster Empty]

The default provider is set to "Google Cloud Platform." This is the only provider available during the alpha.

image::astra-select-provider.png[Astra Select Provider]

The cluster registration process requires a GCP service account file. You can generate this in the **IAM** section of the GCP console.

Project Astra will automatically validate the service account to verify it has access to the necessary APIs and roles.

More information on creating the service account with the required roles can can be found in link:credentials-gcp.html[our article on GCP credentials].

After you have downloaded the service account JSON file, use the "Upload file" option to add it to Project Astra. If you prefer to copy and paste the service account JSON, choose "Paste from Clipboard." If you have previously added a service account, select it on the "Use existing" tab.

image::astra-sa-file-uploaded.png[Service Account JSON File Uploaded]

"Service account name" will be automatically generated based on the `client_email` value in the service account JSON. You are welcome to change it if you wish. This value will appear later under "Use existing" to identify this set of service account credentials.

Click *Discover clusters* to continue. This shows a list of Kubernetes clusters that are currently provisioned.

image::astra-add-compute-select-a-cluster.png[Add Compute Select a Cluster]

Click *Not selected* for the cluster you want to add. *Not selected* will update to *Selected* with a blue checkmark.

image::astra-add-compute-cluster-selected.png[Add Compute Cluster Selected]

Click *Configure storage* to continue. On the next step, choose a storage class.

image::add-compute-select-storage-type.png[Add Compute Select Storage Type]

Click *Review information* to continue.

On the final step, review the information presented on the summary screen. You can navigate back to previous steps if you need to change something. When it all looks good, click *Add compute*.

An information block will provide progress updates as the Kubernetes cluster is registered with Project Astra:

* Astra creates a Google Cloud Object store to store the backups.
* NetApp Trident is deployed as the Container Storage Interface (CSI).
* The Storage Classes for NetApp Cloud Volume Services are configured.

When the process completes, the Add Compute wizard will close by itself and you will see your cluster showing as *Available*.

Repeat these steps to register a second cluster. Once you have two clusters showing as *Available* please continue to the link:alpha-workflows.html[Alpha Workflows] to explore Project Astra.
