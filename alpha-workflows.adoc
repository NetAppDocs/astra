= Project Astra Alpha Workflows

We recommend the following steps as a way of exercising the service.

== Requirements

Before you can begin working with Project Astra, you will need to get your account set up. These articles will help you get up and running.

* link:getting-started.html[Getting Started Guide]
* link:faq.html[FAQ]
* link:invite-users.html[Invite Users]
* link:credentials-cvs.html[Set Up NetApp Cloud Volumes Service]
* link:credentials-gcp.html[Get your GCP Credentials]

NOTE: Private Kubernetes clusters and custom networks are not supported by the Project Astra alpha program. Only publicly-accessible Kubernetes clusters and the default VPC will work in alpha.

== Add a Cluster

Begin by adding a cluster to Project Astra. We cover this process in the link:getting-started.html[Getting Started Guide].

== Deploy an Application

Learn how to deploy MySQL/MariaDB or Postgres from a Helm chart.

* link:mysql-mariadb-deploy-from-helm-chart.html[Deploy MySQL/MariaDB from a Helm chart].
* link:postgres-deploy-from-helm-chart.html[Deploy Postgres from a Helm chart].

== Register an Application

After you deploy an application to your cluster, Project Alpha will detect it. You can then register the application with Project Astra, so that you can use Project Astra to manage your application's data.

== Data Management Operations

Project Astra lets you manage your data with snapshots and backups.

=== Snapshots

Create and manage point-in-time snapshots of your application.

* link:snapshot-create.html[Create a snapshot].
* link:snapshot-view.html[View your snapshots].
* link:snapshot-restore.html[Restore from a snapshot].

=== Backups

Create and manage backups of your application.

* link:backup-create.html[Create a backup].
* link:backup-view.html[View your backups].
* link:backup-restore.html[Restore from a backup].

=== Migrate Data

Use the Clone feature to migrate data between clusters.

* link:migrate-data-between-clusters.html[Migrate data between clusters].

== Deregister

When you are done with the alpha workflow, remove your assets from Project Astra.
