:imagesdir: assets/gcp-credentials/

Learn how to create a new service account for your Google Cloud Platform account from a browser, using the Google Cloud Console.

For instructions on creating a new service account from the command line using the `gcloud` tool, see link:gcp-create-service-account-cli.html[Create a New Service Account (gcloud)].

**Requirements**

* An active GCP account.
* A GCP project. link:gcp-create-project.html[Create a New GCP Project].

**External Resources**

To learn more about GCP service accounts, https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts[see the official Google Cloud documentation].

== Create a Service Account

Log in to the https://console.cloud.google.com/[Google Cloud Console] and go to *APIs and Services > Credentials*. Click *+ CREATE CREDENTIALS*.

Choose *Service account* from the drop-down menu which appears.

Fill in the new Service account name, ID, and description for the Service account you want to create for this project. Click *CREATE* to continue.

Next, grant this Service account permissions for your project. Select a role, then click *Continue* to continue.

The four roles Project Astra requires are:

1. Kubernetes Engine Admin - List clusters and manage apps.
2. Cloud Volumes Admin - Manage persistent storage for apps.
3. Storage Admin - Create storage buckets and objects for app backup.
4. Services Usage - Check if required APIs are enabled.


On the final step, *Grant users access to this service account (optional)* click *+ CREATE KEY* to create a private key.

Select `JSON` as the key type. Click *CREATE* to download the JSON credentials to your local workstation.

When you register a new cluster with Project Astra, find this `.json` file on your local workstation and upload it. You also have the option to open the file with a plaintext editor. Then copy and paste the contents of this key into the field of the registration workflow.

== Next Steps

Now that you have created a service account and the JSON key file, you are ready to provision a new GKE cluster and add it to Project Astra. See our link:getting-started.html[Getting Started Guide] for instructions.
