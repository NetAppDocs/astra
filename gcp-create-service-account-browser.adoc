Learn how to create a new service account using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) console in your browser.

For instructions on creating a new service account from the command line using the `gcloud` tool, please see link:gcp-create-service-account-gcloud.html[Create a New Service Account (gcloud)].

**Requirements**

* An active GCP account.
* A GCP project. link:gcp-create-project.html[Create a New GCP Project].

**External Resources**

To learn more about GCP service accounts, https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts[see the official Google Cloud documentation].

== Create a Service Account

Log in to the https://console.cloud.google.com/[Google Cloud Console] and go to *IAM and Admin > Service Accounts*. Click *+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT*.

Fill in the "Service account name" field. In the example below, the service account name is *astra-alpha*. The "Service account ID" field is automatically generated, but can be modified. You may add an optional "Service account description. Click *CREATE* to continue.

Next, grant this Service account permissions for your project. GCP has a large number of roles. We can use the filter to quickly locate the ones required for Project Astra. Click in the *Select a role* field, then type or paste in the role name from the list below. Once it appears in the results list, click on it to add that role. In the image below, *Compute Network Viewer* was entered in the filter list. Clicking the result, outlined in the red box, will add that role.

Click *+ ADD ANOTHER ROLE* and repeat the process for each required role.

The five roles Project Astra requires are:

1. *Compute Network Viewer*
2. *Kubernetes Engine Admin*
3. *NetApp Cloud Volumes Admin*
4. *Service Usage Viewer*
5. *Storage Admin*

When _all_ five roles have been added, click the *CONTINUE* button.

The third step is optional. You may click *DONE* to finish and be returned to the list of service accounts.

Locate the service account that was just created and use the *Actions* menu at the end of the row to *Create key*. Leave the radio button set to JSON and press *CREATE*.

A JSON file for the service account will be created and saved to your local workstation.

Don't be too alarmed by the warning about not being able to recover the key file if lost. You can delete a "lost" key and generate a new one anytime.

== Next Steps

Congratulations! You have successfully created a service account with the required roles and downloaded the JSON key file.

In the first step of the Project Astra Add Compute wizard, you will be prompted to find this `.json` file on your local workstation and upload it. See the link:getting-started.html[Getting Started Guide] for additional instructions.
