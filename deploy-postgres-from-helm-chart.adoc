= Deploy Postgres From a Helm Chart

Learn how to exercise the Project Astra workflow by deploying Postgres from a Helm chart. After you deploy Postgres on your cluster, you can register the application with Project Astra.


NOTE: The Project Astra Alpha Program only supports Postgres 11.7.

== System Requirements

In order to deploy Postgres from a Helm chart for the Project Astra alpha program, you need the following:

* A fresh GKE cluster which has been added to Project Astra.
* Kubectl and Helm installed.
* Kubeconfig configured using the gcloud tool with a command like `gcloud container clusters get-credentials my-cluster-name`

NOTE: You must deploy your app after the cluster is added to Project Astra, not before.

== Install Postgres

To exercise the Project Astra alpha workflow, we recommend the https://hub.helm.sh/charts/bitnami/postgresql[Bitnami Postgres chart].

To install this chart, first add the repo:

----
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
----

NOTE: You must deploy the Helm chart in a namespace other than the default.

Deploy Postgres with the command:

----
helm install bitnami/postgresql --namespace my-postgres-namespace --create-namespace --set postgresqlPassword=U9dH9HT4pWS,postgresqlDatabase=test_db --generate-name
----

This command does the following:

* Creates a new namespace `my-postgres-namespace`.
* Deploys Postgres on that namespace.
* Creates a database named `test_db`
* Creates a user `test_db_user` with password `U9dH9HT4pWS`

WARNING: This method of setting the password at deployment is insecure. Only use this command when setting up Postgres for a sandbox deployment to use Project Astra alpha program. We do not recommend this for a production environment.

After the Helm chart is deployed, it will be automatically detected by Project Astra, at which point you can register the app with Project Astra. Please note that for the Project Astra alpha program, it can take up to 5 minutes for applications to show up in the Discovered Applications list after being installed.
