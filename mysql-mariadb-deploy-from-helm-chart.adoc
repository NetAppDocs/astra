= Deploy MySQL/MariaDB From a Helm Chart

Learn how to exercise the Project Astra workflow by deploying MariaDB from a Helm chart. After you deploy MariaDB on your cluster, you can register the application with Project Astra.

NOTE: The Project Astra alpha program only supports MySQL 0.3.22 and MariaDB 14.14.

== System Requirements

In order to deploy MySQL/MariaDB from a Helm chart for the Project Astra alpha program, you need the following:

* A fresh GKE cluster which has been added to Project Astra.
* Kubectl and Helm installed.
* Kubeconfig configured using the gcloud tool with a command like `gcloud container clusters get-credentials my-cluster-name`

NOTE: You must deploy your app after the cluster is added to Project Astra, not before.

== Install MariaDB

To exercise the Project Astra alpha workflow, we recommend you use the Helm chart which we have customized for Project Astra. link:assets/mariadb.zip[Click here to download the compressed folder].

NOTE: You must deploy the Helm chart in a namespace other than the default.

Deploy MariaDB with the command:

----
helm install mariadb ./mariadb --namespace my-mariadb-namespace --create-namespace --set db.database=test_db,db.user=test_db_user,db.password=NKhjs2wQPt8 > /dev/null 2>&1
----

This command does the following:

* Creates a new namespace `my-mariadb-namespace`.
* Deploys MariaDB on that namespace.
* Creates a database named `test_db`
* Creates a user `test_db_user` with password `NKhjs2wQPt8`

WARNING: This method of setting the password at deployment is insecure. Only use this command when setting up MySQL/MariaDB for a sandbox deployment to use Project Astra alpha program. We do not recommend this for a production environment.

After the Helm chart is deployed, it will be automatically detected by Project Astra, at which point you can register the app with Project Astra. Please note that for the Project Astra alpha program, installed applications can take up to 5 minutes to show up in the Discovered Applications list.
